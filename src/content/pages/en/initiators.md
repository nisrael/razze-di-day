# Initiators

Digital Independence Day is an initiative for digital self-determination and privacy.

## Our Mission

We want to support people in achieving digital independence. Every first Sunday of the month, we encourage everyone to take a step toward privacy-friendly and ethical digital services.

## Why Digital Independence Day?

Big tech corporations collect massive amounts of data, influence our perception through algorithms, and have an enormous impact on our lives. However, there are privacy-friendly and ethical alternatives for almost every service.

## Our Values

- **Privacy**: Your data belongs to you
- **Transparency**: Open systems and open source
- **Independence**: No dependency on big corporations
- **Community**: Together we are stronger

## Get Involved

- Share your experiences with alternatives

- Organize local events on the first Sunday
- Create your own recipes

## Supporters & Partners

Digital Independence Day is supported by various organizations and individuals dedicated to digital rights, privacy, and open source.
